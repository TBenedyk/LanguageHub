== Welcome to LanguageHub

This tool will return the dominant language used by a particular GitHub user.

1. Launch the Rails Console:
       $ rails c

2. Run the lookup command:
       Lookup.language("username")

The languages used by the GitHub user are returned in order of the amount of bytes used, followed by their dominant language.
